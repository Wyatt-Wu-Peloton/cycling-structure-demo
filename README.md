This repo contains a program that <describe in a brief parragraph what the application does>

# Setting Development Environment
LabVIEW 2020
<add any toolkits below>
* for example LabVIEW Sound and Vibration Toolkit

Apply the Development Tools.vipc file to ensure you have all the Peloton tools used to develop this project (for example: Pelobuttons, Peloton custom VI Analyzer tests, DQMH, etc).
<make sure to update the Development Tools.vipc with any other tools developers will need to work on this project>

Apply the <Rename As Application Name>.vipc to ensure all the code dependencies are installed
<make sure to update and rename the <Rename As Application Name>.vipc with any other dependencies your project needs to run>

# VI Analyzer
After making any changes to the code, make sure to run VI Analyzer loading the VI Analyzer/Rename As Application Name.viancfg 

It is OK to exclude from VI Analyzer any VIs that are part of scripted code (such as DQMH Requests, DQMHS Broadcasts, etc). For more details on the Peloton LabVIEW Style Guidelines, visit https://pelotoncycle.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/HM/pages/41312617705/LabVIEW+Style+Guidelines
